# Kodi--Json-Powershell
This repository is a translation of Json-RPC Commands for Kodi into powershell as best as I am able too. Feel free to copy as needed and do with as you please. I am doing this out of a labor of love and desire to have kodi json commands in a readable format. Simply set your username, password, and ipaddress of your client at the top of the script and highlight the code chunk you wish to run. These are not intended to be ran as full functional scripts.
